# Movie Recommendation System

A **Movie Recommendation System** developed using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Jupyter Notebook**. This system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user input and collaborative filtering techniques. The project leverages the **MovieLens 100k dataset** to generate recommendations by identifying similar users through **cosine similarity**.

## 📈 Features
- **Personalized Movie Recommendations** based on user ratings.
- **Collaborative Filtering** using **Cosine Similarity**.
- Processed data from `u.data`, `u.item`, and `u.user` files from the **MovieLens 100k dataset**.
- Easy-to-use Python-based interface for generating movie recommendations.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the recommendation logic.
- **Scikit-learn**: For calculating cosine similarity.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and presenting the analysis interactively.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prabhatadvait/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Load and preprocess the dataset files (`u.data`, `u.item`, `u.user`).
2. Merge the data to include movie titles alongside ratings.
3. Allow the user to input ratings for selected movies.
4. Generate personalized movie recommendations based on similar user profiles.
5. Visualize the top movie recommendations using a bar chart.
